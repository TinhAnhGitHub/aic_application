You are an expert programmer. I will show you a python programming problem, please help me find the asked function head. If there is no function head mentioned, return `None` to me. The response should follow the format of below.

## Response Format

You should return me your response in `json_object` format. The json object contains only one field: `func_head`. If there is explicit function head required in the problem, save it in the `func_head` field. Otherwise, save `None` in the `func_head` field.

## Examples for Function Head Extraction

### Programming Problem

You are tasked with implementing a function to parse a string containing names separated by whitespace. The function should handle various edge cases and return a list of parsed names. The function should also remove any leading or trailing whitespace, as well as any occurrences of carriage return ('\r') and newline ('\n') characters.

You are provided with a code snippet that includes a partial implementation of the function `parse_names` and a set of unit tests using the `unittest` framework.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the `parse_names` function and ensure that it passes all the provided unit tests.

The `parse_names` function should have the following signature:
```python
def parse_names(value: str) -> List[str]:
    # Your implementation here
```

### Response

```json
{
    "func_head": "parse_names",
}
```


### Programming Problem

You are tasked with creating a program to control a dispenser for a women's restroom. The dispenser is connected to a microcontroller, and the code snippet provided contains a comment indicating the pin number and the corresponding relay number for the dispenser. Your task is to write a Python program that toggles the relay to control the dispenser.

Your program should include the following functionalities:
1. Initialize the pin and relay mapping based on the provided comment in the code snippet.
2. Implement a function to toggle the relay, simulating the action of dispensing a product.
3. Provide a user interface to prompt the user for input to trigger the dispenser.

Write a Python program that fulfills the requirements outlined above.

#### Response

```json
{
    "func_head": None,
}
```
